# Analysis of tar data-obtained from underground coal gasification
Technologies: ChromaTOF Tile, Microsoft Excel, and R


Introduction: Coal is an important source of energy supply, amounting to over one-third of generated electricity in the world (cite iea.org). Although there are a lot of issues on the burning of coal in the environment and the increase in the use of cleaner energy sources, the demand for coal as a source of energy supply is still expected to grow.
The amount of minable coal or easy to access coal is known to be decreasing and there is need for a technology to access these hard to mine coals which are coals located very deep in the ground or too thin.
This hard to mine coal can be accessed by Underground coal gasification (UCG.)  UCG is a technology for obtaining syngas from hard coal directly in the coal seam. Apart from the ability to mine deep coal seams, it has a potential for carbon capturing and it also cuts the danger mining of coal brings to miners.

However, UCG has not been commercially adopted, and one of the reasons is because of the lack of set parameters to control and monitor the process. This work carried out an exploratory analysis on coal tar samples from a UCG mine whose reactor got exposed to air, leading to the termination of the trial. The goal of this study was to find chemical trends and the chemical features of these trends that could be monitored through the UCG process to determine exposure in an underground reactor.
The analysis was carried out using non-targeted two-dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry techniques. This was equipped with ChromaTOF Tile, which uses the Fisher ratio and principal component analysis statistical tools to find distinguishing compounds, cluster samples, and find the compounds responsible for the sample clustering. Microsoft Excel and R studio was used to further group the samples and perform analysis on the dataset. The compounds fell under five major categories: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogenous compounds, oxygenic compounds, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and sulfuric compounds. Some group of compounds (Alkanes and alkenes, benzene and its derivatives, oxygenic and nitrogenous) were found to have massive increase or decrease after the reactor got exposed. This led them to be highlighted as key groups to be monitored to determine exposure in the reactor.
